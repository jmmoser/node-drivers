- v3
  - [x] Move eip directly under layers
  - [x] Remove CIPInternalLayer and just keep as CIPLayer
  - [ ] EPath allow encoding without creating segment objects
  - [ ] Change sendNextMessage to a service that is only called by the base class, and returns true if a message was sent, return false if no message was sent. In the base class call setImmediate(() => this.sendNextMessage()); if the returned value is true.
